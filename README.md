Zotero to Obsidian Import Template

This repository contains an Obsidian template designed for importing annotations and metadata from Zotero into Obsidian. The template leverages HTML and templating logic to format annotations into visually appealing cards.
Features

    Annotation Cards: Each annotation is displayed as a card with a header (color, type) and content (comment, annotated text, images).
    Page Labels: If available, the annotation includes a clickable page label linked to the source.
    Tags Display: Tags are shown after the annotation blocks, ensuring they appear at the top of the note when rendered in reading mode.

Known Issues

    Tags in Read Mode: Although the template generally shows tags above all, there may be minor issues with tag display in reading mode. These issues are mostly cosmetic.
    Backlinks Not Rendered as Markdown: If your annotation includes backlinks, they will not be rendered as Markdown because the template styling uses HTML. As a result, backlinks will appear as plain text instead of clickable links.

Usage

    Clone this Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/parsamahdavi48/Obsidian-Zotero-Template.git

    Import the Template into Obsidian:
    Copy the template file into your Obsidian vault and adjust the settings as needed for your Zotero data.

    Customize as Needed:
    Feel free to modify the HTML/CSS or templating logic to better suit your workflow or to address any display issues.
